# Ticket Management System - OpenUI5 with Typescript

Rewritten version of the [Ticket Management System](https://github.com/alikapllan/Ticket-Management-System-openui5) project, now using **TypeScript** with OpenUI5, Node.js, and PostgreSQL.

- Changed nothing, kept all features. Just converted all .js files to TypeScript to level up my TypeScript skills 😁. It provides better type safety, structure, and maintainability.
